- I have to access the source list from the top to inside
- and the new list from inside to the top (don't know how to do that)

- [x] rust "too many linked lists"
    - rust_study.ws/lists/README.md
- [] refactor functions and list manipulations based on what I learned in too many linked lists
- [] watch videos about liked lists

```
func(level, node) -> node {
    if (  ) {

    } else {

    }
}

func(3, node_5) -> node_3;

// iterate over linked_list;

list {
    val: 5,
    next: list {
        val: 4,
        next: ...
    }
}


iterate(list_in, stop) {
    new_list = list::new();
    list = list_in.clone();
    loop {
        new_list = list;
    }
}


```
